# Robust-and-Adaptive-Control
For a class in Robust & Adaptive Control, I created Matlab implementations of LQR, RSLQR, H-infinity, LQGLTR contorllers in a state-space framework.  Also, I implemented extensive time-domain and frequency domain analyses, along with useful frameworks for using these analyses to determine optimal gains.  All of these scripts are implemented towards aircraft control applications, but these control frameworks can be easily transferred to other problems.
