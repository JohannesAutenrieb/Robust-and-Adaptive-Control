# Robust-and-Adaptive-Control
For a class in Robust & Adaptive Control, I created Matlab implementations of LQR, RSLQR, H-infinity, and LQGLTR state-feedback controllers.  

Further built into these implementations are extensive time-domain and frequency domain analyses, along with useful frameworks for using these analyses to determine optimal gains.  

All of these scripts are implemented towards aircraft control applications, but these control frameworks can be transferred to other problems.
